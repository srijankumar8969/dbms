both foster parallelism
partitioning means dividing the table vertiically or horiontally within the same database
but sharding means dividing horizontally and distributing over different servers using various strategies like range, geographical, ... etc.
    adds complexity to the system
    not easy to implement 
    may cause incosistency
    joins become very expensive
    adv ->
    inc availability
    decrease latency
    highly scalable

sharding stratigies:
    1. range based 
    2. hashing based 
    3. consistent hashing
    4. geographical based
    5. directory based -> a directory decides where data goes 
    5. vertical sharding -> sharding on the basis of table/column instead of row

//CAP theorem
    atmax two of consistency, availability and partition tolerance can be assured in a distributed stateful system
