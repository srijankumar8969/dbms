DBMS provides abstraction of different level:
    three level architecture -> hides the unnecessary complexity of the database systems
    1. physical level schema-> how data is stored in the actual memeory
    2. logical level schema-> how data is structured in the data base and what is the relationship between the data
        Database admonistrator(DBA) uses the logical level of schema
    3. view level schema-> describes how data will be represented to the end user
        May contain many schemas which can be considered as subschema
    (schema defines how data will be organised either at the internal, logical or external level).
