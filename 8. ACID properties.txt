Transaction : a unit of work that occurs one after the other in sequence.

A -> atomicity means that a transaction either completes or completely rolls back
C -> consistency means data must be consistent after all transctions
I -> isolation means that all the transactions occuring concurrently are independent and dont interfare each other
D -> durability means one the transaction is commitedd then the data must not be lost

states of transaction are:
active, partially commited, commited, terminated
active, falied, terminated
active, partially commited, failed, terminated

-> partially commited means the changes are stored in the buffer of the main memory

//methods to ensure atomicity and consistency
1. shadow copy scheme
    in each transaction a new copy of the database is crated in ram changes are made to it and once db pointer points to it and old one is deleted then it is commited
    -> downside of it is, its very slow due to db replication
    talk about how atomicity and durability are ensured here
    writing of db pointer is atomic thus changing of it cant cause durability issues
2. log based recovery method
    i> deffered db modification : first log table is written then the changes are made one the pointer reaches the commited state then things are saved. if during mod failure happen then just redo.
    ii> immediate db modification : if failure happend then redo happens to the initial state of last log
