different type of models->

    2. relational model
    3. object oriented model
    4. Hirerchial model

/*Data model = idea or design
Schema = actual structure in DB*/


-> ways to interact with the database
    1. both client and db at the same computer
    2. both can be on differnet computer but the interaction happens ddirectly
    3. there is a layer of abstraction as the server is making request for the client to the database
