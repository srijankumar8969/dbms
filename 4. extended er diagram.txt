extended er features:
 1. generalization : when some attribute is redundant among two entities then we simply make a specialized entity and those earlier becomes relation to that with an is-a relationship
 2. specialization : means some specailized branches created if there is some attributes which are applicable to some and not to others

both has attribute inheritance and both endup giving the same result
if parant participate in some relationship then child also does
 3. aggregation : it is used to treat some set of entities as higher entities

//how to make an er diagram
    1. find the entities
    2. find attributes and its types
    3. find relation and constraints on that relation -> 1. mapping cardianility 2. participation type
    //not required but think of extendes er features
