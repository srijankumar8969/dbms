represents the data as rows and columns 
entities becomes tables 
attributes becomes columns
(degree of table means no of attributes)
(cardinality means no of rows in a table)
rdbms is the software for implimenting relation data
relational model keys:
super key -> set of attributes that are important for uniquily identifing a row 
candidate key -> minimizing the size of super key, means if any further attribute is removed from the set of a candidate key then the thing cant be identified uniquely
primary key ->
alternate key ->
forign key ->
surrogatory key -> primarykey generated automatically by the db
composite key ->pk from atleast 2 attributes
compound key -> pk with 2 foreign key

//integrity constraints -> imp to keep the data secure 
domain constraints
entity constraints
referential constraints
        if something related to a key is present in the referncing table then its value cant be removed fromt he refernced table 
        two solutions for that:
            1. on delete cascade
            2. on delete set null
